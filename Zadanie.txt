Simple gallery

Create simple gallery (Gallery.png) which display few images (located in Photos folder). 
When user click on some image you should open selected photo bigger (modal dialog) (SelectedPhotoView.png)
 and on right side show EXIF data of the image (you can use https://github.com/exif-js/exif-js). 
If photo contains GPS coordinates show Google Map with center point where the image is taken.

Note:
Put all images into Array where each photo will be in JSON object with the following structure:

[
	{
		filename: "",
		title: ""
	},
	...
]

On this stage load all images from the array and add them into the gallery.
